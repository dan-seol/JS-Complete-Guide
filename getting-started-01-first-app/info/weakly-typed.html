         Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
        containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
        you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
        sure you're always working with the correct values.That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
        and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script).
